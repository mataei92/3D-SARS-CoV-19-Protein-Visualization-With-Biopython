# 3D-SARS-CoV-19-Protein-Visualization-With-Biopython
In this project Biopython is used to handle biological sequence data stored in FASTA, PDB and xml format. First the sequence data is loaded from the FASTA file,and then it's details such as id, sequence, length, GC content and molecular weight are extracted. The sequence is then translated to yield the protein sequence. After translation, the length of protein sequence and the most common aminoacids present in the sequence are extracted. Utilizing the stop coden the sequence is split to yield the list of protein sequences present. 
Now that the protein sequence is extracted, NCBIBLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) is applied to identify the best aligned sequence for the largest protein among the protein sequences. Looking at the BLAST results, among the matched proteins, the second one represents the nsp12 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 protein. The PDB (protein data bank) id of this protein is extracted from our BLAST result and is used to retrieve the structural file of SARS-CoV-2 protein from PDB database. This information is used to visualize SARS-CoV-2 protein nglview package.
